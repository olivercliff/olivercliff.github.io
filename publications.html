                                                The ability to quantify complex relationships within multivariate time series is a key component
                                                of modelling many physical systems, from the climate to brains and other biophysical phenomena.
                                                Unfortunately, even testing the significance of simple dependence measures, such as Pearson
                                                correlation, is complicated by altered sampling properties when autocorrelation is present
                                                in the individual time series. Moreover, it has been recently established that commonly used
                                                multivariate dependence measures---such as Granger causality---can produce substantially
                                                inaccurate results when applying classical hypothesis-testing procedures to digitally-filtered
                                                time series. Here, we suggest that the digital filtering-induced bias in Granger causality is
                                                an effect of autocorrelation, and we present a principled statistical framework for the hypothesis
                                                testing of a large family of linear-dependence measures between multiple autocorrelated time
                                                series. Our approach unifies the theoretical foundations established by Bartlett and others on
                                                variance estimators for autocorrelated signals with the more intricate multivariate measures of
                                                linear dependence. Specifically, we derive the sampling distributions and subsequent hypothesis
                                                tests for any measure that can be decomposed into terms that involve independent partial
                                                correlations, which we show includes Granger causality and mutual information under a multivariate
                                                linear-Gaussian model. In doing so, we provide the first exact tests for inferring linear
                                                dependence between vector autoregressive processes with limited data. Using numerical simulations
                                                and brain-imaging datasets, we demonstrate that our newly developed tests maintain the expected
                                                false-positive rate (FPR) with minimally-sufficient samples, while the classical log-likelihood
                                                ratio tests can yield an unbounded FPR depending on the parameters chosen.

                                                There is a continuing debate on relative benefits of various mitigation and suppression strategies aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. Here we report the results of agent-based modelling using a fine-grained computational simulation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. This model is calibrated to match key characteristics of COVID-19 transmission. An important calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction for adults. We apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits unless coupled with high level of social distancing compliance. We report several trade-offs, and an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels, with compliance at the 90% level found to control the disease within 13–14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.

                                                We examine non-typhoidal Salmonella (S. Typhimurium or STM) epidemics
                                                as complex systems, driven by evolution and interactions of diverse
                                                microbial strains, and focus on emergence of successful strains.
                                                Our findings challenge the established view that seasonal epidemics
                                                are associated with random sets of co-circulating STM genotypes. We
                                                use high-resolution molecular genotyping data comprising 17,107 STM
                                                isolates representing nine consecutive seasonal epidemics in Australia,
                                                genotyped by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis
                                                (MLVA). From these data, we infer weighted undirected networks based
                                                on distances between the MLVA profiles, depicting epidemics as networks
                                                of individual bacterial strains. The network analysis demonstrated
                                                dichotomy in STM populations which split into two distinct genetic
                                                branches, with markedly different prevalences. This distinction revealed
                                                the emergence of dominant STM strains defined by their local network
                                                topological properties, such as centrality, while correlating the
                                                development of new epidemics with global network features, such as
                                                small-world propensity.

                                                Understanding animal movements that underpin ecosystem processes is
                                                fundamental to ecology. Recent advances in animal tags have increased
                                                the ability to remotely locate larger species; however, this technology
                                                is not suitable for up to 70% of the world’s bird and mammal species.
                                                The most widespread technique for tracking small animals is to manually
                                                locate low-power radio transmitters from the ground with handheld
                                                equipment. Despite this labor-intensive technique being used for
                                                decades, efforts to reduce or automate this process have had limited
                                                success. Here, we present an approach for tracking small radio-tagged
                                                animals by using an autonomous and lightweight aerial robot. We
                                                present experimental results where we used the robot to locate
                                                critically endangered swift parrots (Lathamus discolor) within their
                                                winter range. The system combines a miniaturized sensor with newly
                                                developed estimation algorithms to yield unambiguous bearing- and
                                                range-based measurements with associated measures of uncertainty.
                                                We incorporated these measurements into Bayesian data fusion and
                                                information-based planning algorithms to control the position of the
                                                robot as it collected data. We report estimated positions that lie
                                                within about 50 meters of the true positions of the birds on average,
                                                which are sufficiently accurate for recapture or observation. Further,
                                                in comparison with experienced human trackers from locations where
                                                the signal was detectable, the robot produced a correct estimate as
                                                fast or faster than the human. These results provide validation of
                                                robotic systems for wildlife radio telemetry and suggest a way for
                                                widespread use as human-assistive or autonomous devices.

                                                In this paper we present AceMod, an agent-based modelling framework
                                                for studying influenza epidemics in Australia. The simulator is
                                                designed to analyse the spatiotemporal spread of contagion and
                                                influenza spatial synchrony across the nation. The individual-based
                                                epidemiological model accounts for mobility (worker and student
                                                commuting) patterns and human interactions derived from the 2006
                                                Australian census and other national data sources. The high-precision
                                                simulation comprises 19.8 million stochastically generated software
                                                agents and traces the dynamics of influenza viral infection and
                                                transmission at several scales. Using this approach, we are able to
                                                synthesise epidemics in Australia with varying outbreak locations and
                                                severity. For each scenario, we investigate the spatiotemporal
                                                profiles of these epidemics, both qualitatively and quantitatively,
                                                via incidence curves, prevalence choropleths, and epidemic synchrony.
                                                This analysis exemplifies the nature of influenza pandemics within
                                                Australia and facilitates future planning of effective intervention,
                                                mitigation and crisis management strategies.

                                                The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is a fundamental measure of information geometry
                                                that is used in a variety of contexts in artificial intelligence. We show that, when
                                                system dynamics are given by distributed nonlinear systems, this measure can be decomposed 
                                                as a function of two information-theoretic measures, transfer entropy and stochastic interaction.
                                                More specifically, these measures are applicable when selecting a candidate model for a
                                                distributed system, where individual subsystems are coupled via latent variables and observed
                                                through a filter. We represent this model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that characterises
                                                the unidirectional coupling between subsystems. Standard approaches to structure learning are
                                                not applicable in this framework due to the hidden variables; however, we can exploit the
                                                properties of certain dynamical systems to formulate exact methods based on differential
                                                topology. We approach the problem by using reconstruction theorems to derive an analytical
                                                expression for the KL divergence of a candidate DAG from the observed dataset. Using this
                                                result, we present a scoring function based on transfer entropy to be used as a subroutine
                                                in a structure learning algorithm. We then demonstrate its use in recovering the structure
                                                of coupled Lorenz and Rössler systems.

                                                We propose a decentralized variant of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that is suitable for a
                                                variety of tasks in multi-robot active perception. Our algorithm allows each robot to optimize
                                                its own actions by maintaining a probability distribution over plans in the joint-action space.
                                                Robots periodically communicate a compressed form of their search trees, which are used to 
                                                update the joint distribution using a distributed optimization approach inspired by variational
                                                methods. Our method admits any objective function defined over robot action sequences, assumes
                                                intermittent communication, is anytime, and is suitable for online replanning. Our algorithm
                                                features a new MCTS tree expansion policy that is designed for our planning scenario. We extend
                                                the theoretical analysis of standard MCTS to provide guarantees for convergence rates to the
                                                optimal payoff sequence. We evaluate the performance of our method for generalized team orienteering
                                                and online active object recognition using real data, and show that it compares favorably to
                                                centralized MCTS even with severely degraded communication. These examples demonstrate the
                                                suitability of our algorithm for real-world active perception with multiple robots.

                                                We examine salient trends of influenza pandemics in Australia, a rapidly urbanizing nation.
                                                To do so, we implement state-of-the-art influenza transmission and progression models within
                                                a large-scale stochastic computer simulation, generated using comprehensive Australian census
                                                datasets from 2006, 2011, and 2016. Our results offer a simulation-based investigation of a
                                                population’s sensitivity to pandemics across multiple historical time points and highlight
                                                three notable trends in pandemic patterns over the years: increased peak prevalence, faster
                                                spreading rates, and decreasing spatiotemporal bimodality. We attribute these pandemic trends
                                                to increases in two key quantities indicative of urbanization: the population fraction residing
                                                in major cities and international air traffic. In addition, we identify features of the pandemic’s
                                                geographic spread that we attribute to changes in the commuter mobility network. The generic 
                                                nature of our model and the ubiquity of urbanization trends around the world make it likely for
                                                our results to be applicable in other rapidly urbanizing nations.

                                                We develop and apply several novel methods quantifying dynamic multi-agent team interactions.
                                                These interactions are detected information-theoretically and captured in two ways: via
                                                (i) directed networks (interaction diagrams) representing significant coupled dynamics
                                                between pairs of agents, and (ii) state-space plots (coherence diagrams) showing coherent 
                                                structures in Shannon information dynamics. This model-free analysis relates, on the one
                                                hand, the information transfer to responsiveness of the agents and the team, and, on the other
                                                hand, the information storage within the team to the team's rigidity and lack of tactical
                                                flexibility. The resultant interaction and coherence diagrams reveal implicit interactions,
                                                across teams, that may be spatially long-range. The analysis was verified with a statistically
                                                significant number of experiments (using simulated football games, produced during RoboCup 2D
                                                Simulation League matches), identifying the zones of the most intense competition, the extent
                                                and types of interactions, and the correlation between the strength of specific interactions
                                                and the results of the matches.

                                                The behaviour of many real-world phenomena can be modelled by nonlinear dynamical systems
                                                whereby a latent system state is observed through a filter. We are interested in interacting
                                                subsystems of this form, which we model by a set of coupled maps as a synchronous update
                                                graph dynamical systems. Specifically, we study the structure learning problem for spatially
                                                distributed dynamical systems coupled via a directed acyclic graph. Unlike established
                                                structure learning procedures that find locally maximum posterior probabilities of a network
                                                structure containing latent variables, our work exploits the properties of dynamical systems
                                                to compute globally optimal approximations of these distributions. We arrive at this result
                                                by the use of time delay embedding theorems. Taking an information-theoretic perspective,
                                                we show that the log-likelihood has an intuitive interpretation in terms of information transfer.

                                                We propose a decentralised variant of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that is suitable
                                                for a variety of tasks in multi-robot active perception. Our algorithm allows each robot
                                                to optimise its own individual action space by maintaining a probability distribution
                                                over plans in the joint-action space. Robots periodically communicate a compressed form
                                                of these search trees, which are used to update the locally-stored joint distributions
                                                using an optimisation approach inspired by variational methods. Our method admits any
                                                objective function defined over robot actions, assumes intermittent communication, and
                                                is anytime. We extend the analysis of the standard MCTS for our algorithm and characterise
                                                asymptotic convergence under reasonable assumptions. We evaluate the practical performance
                                                of our method for generalised team orienteering and active object recognition using real
                                                data, and show that it compares favourably to centralised MCTS even with severely degraded
                                                communication. These examples support the relevance of our algorithm for real-world active
                                                perception with multi-robot systems.

                                                Adversarial patrolling is an algorithmic problem where a robot visits sites within a
                                                given area so as to detect the presence of an adversary. We formulate and solve a new
                                                variant of this problem where intrusion events occur at discrete locations and are
                                                assumed to be clustered in time. Unlike related formulations, we model the behaviour
                                                of the adversary using a stochastic point process known as the reactive point process,
                                                which naturally models temporally self-exciting events such as pest intrusion and weed
                                                growth in agriculture. We present an asymptotically optimal, anytime algorithm based on
                                                Monte Carlo tree search that plans the motion of a robot given a separate event detection
                                                system in order to regulate event propagation at the sites it visits. We illustrate the
                                                behaviour of our algorithm in simulation using several scenarios, and compare its
                                                performance to a lawnmower planning algorithm. Our results indicate that our formulation
                                                and solution are promising in enabling practical applications and further theoretical extensions.

                                                The application of autonomous robots to efficiently locate small wildlife species
                                                has the potential to provide significant ecological insights not previously possible

                                                policy and management. We present an approach for autonomously localizing radio-tagged
                                                wildlife using a small aerial robot. We present a novel two-point phased array antenna

                                                We present several novel methods quantifying dynamic interactions in simulated football games.
                                                These interactions are captured in directed networks that represent significant coupled dynamics,
                                                detected information-theoretically. The model-free approach measures information dynamics of
                                                both pair-wise players’ interactions as well as local tactical contests produced during RoboCup
                                                2D Simulation League games. This analysis involves computation of information transfer and
                                                storage, relating the information transfer to responsiveness of the players and the team, and
                                                the information storage within the team to the team’s rigidity and lack of tactical flexibility.
                                                The resultant directed networks (interaction diagrams) and the measures of responsiveness and
                                                rigidity reveal implicit interactions, across teams, that may be delayed and/or long-ranged.
                                                The analysis was verified with a number of experiments, identifying the zones of the most
                                                intense competition and the extent of interactions.

                                                Robust manipulation with tractability in unstructured environments is a prominent hurdle in robotics.
                                                Learning algorithms to control robotic arms have introduced elegant solutions to the complexities
                                                faced in such systems. A novel method of Reinforcement Learning (RL), Gaussian Process Dynamic
                                                Programming (GPDP), yields promising results for closed-loop control of a low-cost manipulator however
                                                research surrounding most RL techniques lack breadth of comparable experiments into the viability of
                                                particular learning techniques on equivalent environments. We introduce several model-based learning
                                                agents as mechanisms to control a noisy, low-cost robotic system. The agents were tested in a simulated
                                                domain for learning closed-loop policies of a simple task with no prior information. Then, the fidelity
                                                of the simulations is confirmed by application of GPDP to a physical system.

                                                The RoboCup 2D Simulation League incorporates several challenging features, setting a benchmark for Artificial Intelligence.
                                                In this paper we describe some of the ideas and tools used in development of our team, Gliders2013. In doing so, we focus
                                                on information dynamics as one of the central mechanisms for tactical analysis. This analysis involves computation of
                                                information transfer and storage, relating the information transfer to responsiveness of the players, and the information
                                                storage within the team to the team’s rigidity and lack of tactical richness. The proposed approach has been successfully
                                                applied to tactical opponent modelling.
